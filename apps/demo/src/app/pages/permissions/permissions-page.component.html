The following example shows basic usage of
<code>PermissionsService</code>
:

<pre><code [highlight]="basicSample"></code></pre>

@let error = error$ | async;
@let geolocationState = geolocationState$ | async;

@if (error) {
    <div>
        Unfortunately we could not show what the code snippet above would render due to an error:
        <br />
        <b>{{ error }}</b>
    </div>
}

@if (geolocationState) {
    <div>
        <p>The sample above would render the following:</p>

        <hr />
        <h2 class="align-center">Geolocation state: {{ geolocationState }}</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>Go ahead and change your browser Location permission as shown below to see this change reflected above.</p>

        <div class="align-center">
            <img
                alt="Click on 'View site information' icon next to the address bar and change selected permission for Location"
                src="assets/change-permissions-instructions.jpg"
            />
        </div>
    </div>
}
