<strong>Angular</strong>
does not have any built-in instruments to use
<strong>Geolocation API</strong>
. This is an
<code>Observable</code>
based abstraction over
<strong>Geolocation API</strong>
to use with
<strong>Angular</strong>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
    Usage is pretty simple: just import service in your component and subscribe to it. Service extends
    <code>Observable</code>
    and will emit the
    <code>Position</code>
    object.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]="sample"></code></pre>

<p>You also can use async pipe</p>

<pre><code [highlight]="sampleAsync"></code></pre>

<h2>Single position</h2>
<p>
    If you need to get position just once and stop observing user location, you can subscribe to
    <code>geolocation$</code>
    and use
    <code>take(1)</code>
    RxJS operator. Service is cold, meaning if there are no Subscribers, it doesn't track position
</p>

@if (watch) {
    @let position = geolocation$ | async;

    @if (position) {
        <iframe
            alt="url"
            title="geolocation"
            [src]="getUrl(position)"
        ></iframe>
    } @else {
        <tui-loader />
    }
} @else {
    <button
        appearance="secondary"
        tuiButton
        type="button"
        (click)="watch = true"
    >
        Get my position!
    </button>
}
